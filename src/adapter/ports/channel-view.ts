 *   suppress its completion notice. The UI therefore never calls `read()`.
 *   Output mirroring has two tiers: when the kernel event bus is reachable
 *   (`events.subscribe`, present on the real registry) the UI keeps its own
 *   byte cursor and pulls non-consuming `readAt` increments on every
 *   `output` event — live output without the model polling; on kernels
 *   without the bus it falls back to mirroring the agent's own `job_output`
 *   tool results as they stream through the session event log
 *   ({@link BackgroundJobStore.onOutputSeen}).
 * - Jobs are process-local and owner-fenced. `list(agent)` returns exactly
 *   the jobs the current conversation owns (plus unowned ones); a job that
 *   disappears while live was teardown-cancelled (owner disposal / session
 *   swap) and is frozen as `killed` so no transcript card ticks forever.
